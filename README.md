## Class_Projects

This repository is dedicated to the class projects I have done and in the process of doing. These projects conists of simple data exploration, linear regression, logistic regressions, xgboost, roc curves, decsion trees, and importance plots. More information about these projects is listed in the html file I attached in the specific files. 

**Project 1**:
Is a simple data exploration as seen from the html file and consists of finding relationships between variables as well as fitting the model in a linear regression. 

**Project 2**:
This project consists of an xgboost to predict the highest level of injury you can obtain from a crash. The data is collected from the department of transportation from San Jose.
